## Overview
* This repository contains a combined e-commerce dataset that includes information about users, products, ratings, and reviews in the context of an e-commerce platform. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named 'A Combined E-commerce Dataset.csv'. This README provides an overview of the dataset's structure and fields to help users effectively understand and work with the data.
* In this portfolio, I will have some basic processing, plotting, and analysis of Combined E-commerce Data.

## Data Sources 
The dataset has been constructed by merging data from several sources, bringing together user profiles, product information, and user-generated ratings and reviews. This combined dataset allows for the analysis of user behavior, product performance, and more.
